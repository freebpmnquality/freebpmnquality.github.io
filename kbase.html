                    ARIS (Architecture of Integrated Information Systems) is an approach to enterprise modeling. It offers methods for analyzing processes and taking a holistic view of process design‐management workflow and application processing. The ARIS approach provides a well‐documented, methodological framework for BPM, based on Prof. August Wilhelm Scheer’s research from the 1990s. ARIS uses a modeling language known as Event Driven Process Chain (EPC), which brings multiple aspects of enterprise modeling together using the ARIS House of Business Engineering framework. <b>[<a href="https://www.heflo.com/definitions/what-is-aris-architecture/" target="_blank">Referece</a>]</b>

                    ArchiMate is The Open Group‘s open and independent modelling language for enterprise architecture, supported by different tool vendors and consulting firms. ArchiMate provides instruments to support enterprise architects in describing, analyzing and visualizing the relationships among different architecture domains in an unambiguous way, similar to those well-established disciplines like civil engineering or building and construction using internationally accepted standards for describing their designs. 
                    ArchiMate is a modelling technique (“language”) for describing enterprise architectures. It presents a clear set of concepts within and relationships between architecture domains, and offers a simple and uniform structure for describing the contents of these domains. Just like an architectural drawing in classical building architecture describes the various aspects of the construction and use of a building. <b>[<a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/archimate/what-is-archimate/" target="_blank">Referece</a>]</b>

                <small>
                    Integration Definition (IDEF) is a group of modeling languages used to implement systems and engineer software. These languages are used in data functional modeling, simulation, object-oriented analysis, and knowledge acquisition.
                    The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has assumed the responsibility of funding IDEF since the project launch. IDEF is still used by USAF departments and other military institutions. IDEF is also available in the public domain. IDEF is maintained by Knowledge Based Systems, Inc. and is compatible with manufacturing platforms built during its first launch. Additional software industry applications utilize IDEF on a daily basis.
                    IDEF includes 16 different methods (IDEF1X, IDEF1, IDEF3, etc.). During the modeling process, each method captures a certain data type. In addition to IDEF’s role in model analysis and creation of a system version, IDEF is useful in translating a system into a graphical form. To simplify model transitions, gap analysis is applied in collaboration with IDEF.
                    One of the most common IDEF process applications is the application of IDEF0 to the function modeling of any enterprise. This is applied to graphically model its functions’ controls and operators with different resources used within those control processes, their procedures, and various mutual function interactions. <b>[<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19924/integration-definition--idef" target="_blank">Referece</a>]</b>

                </h5>
                <small>
                    Since business process modeling is considered as the foundation of Business Process Management, it is required to design understandable and modifiable process models used to analyze and improve depicted business processes. Therefore, this article proposes
                    a method for business process model analysis and improvement. The lifecycle of Business Process Management from business process modeling to applying the Business Intelligence and process mining techniques is considered. Existing
                    approaches to business process model analysis are reviewed. Proposed method is based on best practices in business process modeling, process model metrics, and corresponding thresholds. The usage of business process model metrics
                    and thresholds to formalize process modeling guidelines is outlined, as well as the procedure of business process model analysis and improvement is shown. The application of Business Intelligence techniques to support the proposed
                    method is demonstrated.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on the process modeling guidelines, measures and corresponding thresholds are reviewed, as well as the refined process modeling rules, corresponding quality criteria, the generalized quality criterion, and thresholds for its translation into linguistic values are proposed. The data model and software prototype are developed and the validation results are outlined.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    Context. A relevant problem of an approach development used to reduce system or random errors which occur during business process models design is solved. The object of the research includes graphical and mathematical models which describe business process structure. Objective. Minimization of systematic or random errors based on the development of an approach to formation and analysis of a business process structure in IDEF0 notation. Method. The approach to formation and analysis of a business processes structure in IDEF0 notation is proposed. Balancing coefficient, which was modified and augmented, considering weight coefficients of arcs of various types, is used for IDEF0 diagrams analysis. Cohesion types defined in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 2476 standard, which weight coefficients are calculated using their values normalization, are used to define values of arc weight coefficients. Results. The approach to IDEF0 diagrams analysis, which allows defining structural changes of diagrams to satisfy balancing requirements, has been developed. Recommendations obtained as a result of IDEF0 diagrams analysis, which describe product purchase and software release processes, and also recommendations of DevOps concept and SCOR supply chain reference model have been used to transform the source diagrams according to the balancing requirements. Further research may consider using of expert judgments for making decisions on recommendations development. Conclusions. The proposed approach can be used to support activities of collecting, storing, and sharing organizational knowledge allowing to analyze and improve business process models before they are added into an enterprise repository for future reuse to design new solutions. Next studies will consider various approaches to business process models representation in an enterprise repository, corresponding to Archimate, ARIS, and other notations.

                <small>
                    This article considers development of the approach to forming dashboards for business process indicators analysis. The approach idea is based on the dashboard design problem, outlined in analyzed works, which propose a lot of recommendations and best practices, but have a lack of formal approaches to dashboard design definition for specific business process indicators. This study considers application of fuzzy and semantic technologies in order to provide description and analysis of relations between analyzed business process indicators, indicator’s types, and visualization tools. It also considers event log processing of a workflow system, used to execute business processes, which indicators are measured. As a result of implementation and application of the proposed approach, recommendations for a dashboard’s design, based on specific business processes and their performance indicators to be analyzed, can be obtained and implemented. The theoretical essentials, workflow scheme, and early results of the proposed approach are given, future research is outlined.

                    This paper considers a problem of dashboard design in order to improve data analytics and decision making as business intelligence capabilities. Essentials of data warehouses and data marts used as data sources for business intelligence activities are briefly outlined, and the star schema data structure is considered as the most widely used. Data visualization is considered from the perspective of proper visualization graphs and charts selection. It is extremely vital for designed dashboards, since inappropriate visuals may mislead users and shift their focus to wrong things. Bar charts, line charts, and pie charts are considered as the most common visualization graphs. Proposed approach includes two phases: dataset preparation and dataset analysis. While dataset preparation is mostly focused on star schema transformation into flat structures, dataset analysis phase proposes recommendations on which visualizations may be placed on a designed dashboard. In order to propose such recommendations, threshold values of dataset sizes are used. A dashboard design process, which is considered as the baseline of the proposed dashboard design approach, is outlined. Sample dataset in considered, five data subsets are prepared and recommendations on visualization charts for these datasets, which may be placed on a dashboard, are proposed. Obtained results are discussed, conclusions are made, as well as the further research objectives in this field are formulated.

                    In the recent decades, databases have been used in any field of human activity to keep valuable data about ongoing processes. Large amounts of data stored in enterprise databases are useless without having a specialized software tool for data discovery or querying. Most business users that make data-driven decisions usually do not have special training and experience in database querying using special formal languages. Existing solutions are based on “query wizards” and database query forms that require knowledge of a database schema and inconvenient for users without special training. Proposed approach is based on the content-based filtering of already executed queries by usage frequency and similarity criteria in order to suggest relevant queries that may be re-used. It is a baseline of the interactive adaptive system for data analysis, which design and development is outlined in this study. Software prototype was demonstrated and its usage was discussed.

                <small>
                    In the recent decades data has indeed become one of the most valuable assets for government institutions, private businesses, and individual persons. Nowadays almost any software, from social networks and dating mobile applications to large information systems and analytical services for enterprise management, accumulates, stores, and processes data to solve certain problems in their subject areas. Extremely large data volumes are organized in databases that are used as the baseline for almost all of modern software applications. As the most important components of software systems, databases should be carefully designed, since drawbacks at the stage of requirements elicitation may result in exponential growth of defects fixing costs at testing and maintenance phases. Therefore, this study proposes an approach and software tool to database schema generation from textual requirements also known in database design domain as business rules. This may help database designers to rapidly obtain usable database schemas in order to detect and fix defects as early as possible. Moreover, proposed solution may simplify the database design process, since database creation scripts are generated from business rules directly. Thus, instead of coding all the required statements, engineers are only need to check obtained schema and make certain adjustments to data types, unique attributes, or used naming style. This research considers relational model and relational databases, since they are most widely used nowadays. State-of-the-art analysis is made, proposed approach is described in details, software tool with its brief usage examples is described, conclusions are made, and further research directions are formulated.

                    Enterprise Architecture Modeling Support based on Data Extraction from Business Process Models
                </h5>
                <small>This paper presents a problem of enterprise architecture artifacts extraction from business process model collections, which organizations of higher maturity levels tend to manage, in order to build the architecture landscape and apply enterprise architecture management practices. Existing enterprise architecture frameworks, languages, and methodologies are discussed. Proposed approach is based on mapping between business process and enterprise architecture elements in order to present all business architecture artifacts in a single coarse-grained model. The software implementation allows generating business architecture landscapes that could be used for architecture evolution purposes, such as transformation planning or maintenance efforts evaluation.</small>

                    Towards the Generalized Criterion for Evaluation of Business Process Model Quality
                </h5>
                <small>Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on the process modeling guidelines, measures and corresponding thresholds are reviewed, as well as the refined process modeling rules, corresponding quality criteria, the generalized quality criterion, and thresholds for its translation into linguistic values are proposed. The data model and software prototype are developed and the validation results are outlined.</small>

                    An Approach to Development of Interactive Adaptive Software Tool to Support Data Analysis Activity
                </h5>
                <small>In the recent decades, databases have been used in any field of human activity to keep valuable data about ongoing processes. Large amounts of data stored in enterprise databases are useless without having a specialized software tool for data discovery or querying. Most business users that make data-driven decisions usually do not have special training and experience in database querying using special formal languages. Existing solutions are based on “query wizards” and database query forms that require knowledge of a database schema and inconvenient for users without special training. Proposed approach is based on the content-based filtering of already executed queries by usage frequency and similarity criteria in order to suggest relevant queries that may be re-used. It is a baseline of the interactive adaptive system for data analysis, which design and development is outlined in this study. Software prototype was demonstrated and its usage was discussed. Conclusions were made and future research was formulated.</small>

                    An Approach and Software Prototype for Translation of Natural Language Business Rules into Database Structure
                </h5>
                <small>In the recent decades data has indeed become one of the most valuable assets for government institutions, private businesses, and individual persons. Nowadays almost any software, from social networks and dating mobile applications to large information systems and analytical services for enterprise management, accumulates, stores, and processes data to solve certain problems in their subject areas. Extremely large data volumes are organized in databases that are used as the baseline for almost all of modern software applications. As the most important components of software systems, databases should be carefully designed, since drawbacks at the stage of requirements elicitation may result in exponential growth of defects fixing costs at testing and maintenance phases. Therefore, this study proposes an approach and software tool to database schema generation from textual requirements also known in database design domain as business rules. This may help database designers to rapidly obtain usable database schemas in order to detect and fix defects as early as possible. Moreover, proposed solution may simplify the database design process, since database creation scripts are generated from business rules directly. Thus, instead of coding all the required statements, engineers are only need to check obtained schema and make certain adjustments to data types, unique attributes, or used naming style. This research considers relational model and relational databases, since they are most widely used nowadays. State-of-the-art analysis is made, proposed approach is described in details, software tool with its brief usage examples is described, conclusions are made, and further research directions are formulated.</small>

                    Towards the Tokenization of Business Process Models using the Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts
                </h5>
                <small>Business process modeling helps organizations to capture their workflows in a visual manner as diagrams that could be then used to share best practices, identify inefficiencies in ongoing activities, instruct employees, use as reference solutions etc. Design and analysis of business process models are essential technologies of Business Process Management approach, which is successfully adopted and practiced nowadays by many of large and medium enterprises. Therefore, business process models should be considered as organizational assets that depict usable and competitive business solutions, which value could be proven by benchmarking. Single reference business process models or even collections of business process models are already accessible on Internet, sometimes for free or, usually, for purchasing because of the value of transferred knowledge. However, peer-to-peer exchange of business process models on the commercial basis is still far from a unification. At the same time, tremendous growth of the cryptocurrency market and adoption of Bitcoin by governments (first by El Salvador in June 2021) makes crypto-economics, also referred as “tokenomics”, usable for organizational knowledge sharing and exchanging without third party authorities, such as banks or payment systems. Moreover, collaborating parties could reach consensus when exchanging business process models using smart contracts and crypto-tokens to access shared knowledge artifacts. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to business process models tokenization using the blockchain technology and smart contracts. There was proposed an Ethereum smart contract that combines features of the business process model collection and the non-fungible token. A prototype of decentralized application was developed and its usage was demonstrated.</small>
