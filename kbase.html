                </h5>
                <small>
                    Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on the process modeling guidelines, measures and corresponding thresholds are reviewed, as well as the refined process modeling rules, corresponding quality criteria, the generalized quality criterion, and thresholds for its translation into linguistic values are proposed. The data model and software prototype are developed and the validation results are outlined.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    Context. A relevant problem of an approach development used to reduce system or random errors which occur during business process models design is solved. The object of the research includes graphical and mathematical models which describe business process structure. Objective. Minimization of systematic or random errors based on the development of an approach to formation and analysis of a business process structure in IDEF0 notation. Method. The approach to formation and analysis of a business processes structure in IDEF0 notation is proposed. Balancing coefficient, which was modified and augmented, considering weight coefficients of arcs of various types, is used for IDEF0 diagrams analysis. Cohesion types defined in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 2476 standard, which weight coefficients are calculated using their values normalization, are used to define values of arc weight coefficients. Results. The approach to IDEF0 diagrams analysis, which allows defining structural changes of diagrams to satisfy balancing requirements, has been developed. Recommendations obtained as a result of IDEF0 diagrams analysis, which describe product purchase and software release processes, and also recommendations of DevOps concept and SCOR supply chain reference model have been used to transform the source diagrams according to the balancing requirements. Further research may consider using of expert judgments for making decisions on recommendations development. Conclusions. The proposed approach can be used to support activities of collecting, storing, and sharing organizational knowledge allowing to analyze and improve business process models before they are added into an enterprise repository for future reuse to design new solutions. Next studies will consider various approaches to business process models representation in an enterprise repository, corresponding to Archimate, ARIS, and other notations.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    This paper presents a problem of enterprise architecture artifacts extraction from business process model collections, which organizations of higher maturity levels tend to manage, in order to build the architecture landscape and apply enterprise architecture management practices. Existing enterprise architecture frameworks, languages, and methodologies are discussed. Proposed approach is based on mapping between business process and enterprise architecture elements in order to present all business architecture artifacts in a single coarse-grained model. The software implementation allows generating business architecture landscapes that could be used for architecture evolution purposes, such as transformation planning or maintenance efforts evaluation.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    This article considers development of the approach to forming dashboards for business process indicators analysis. The approach idea is based on the dashboard design problem, outlined in analyzed works, which propose a lot of recommendations and best practices, but have a lack of formal approaches to dashboard design definition for specific business process indicators. This study considers application of fuzzy and semantic technologies in order to provide description and analysis of relations between analyzed business process indicators, indicator‚Äôs types, and visualization tools. It also considers event log processing of a workflow system, used to execute business processes, which indicators are measured. As a result of implementation and application of the proposed approach, recommendations for a dashboard‚Äôs design, based on specific business processes and their performance indicators to be analyzed, can be obtained and implemented. The theoretical essentials, workflow scheme, and early results of the proposed approach are given, future research is outlined.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    This paper considers a problem of dashboard design in order to improve data analytics and decision making as business intelligence capabilities. Essentials of data warehouses and data marts used as data sources for business intelligence activities are briefly outlined, and the star schema data structure is considered as the most widely used. Data visualization is considered from the perspective of proper visualization graphs and charts selection. It is extremely vital for designed dashboards, since inappropriate visuals may mislead users and shift their focus to wrong things. Bar charts, line charts, and pie charts are considered as the most common visualization graphs. Proposed approach includes two phases: dataset preparation and dataset analysis. While dataset preparation is mostly focused on star schema transformation into flat structures, dataset analysis phase proposes recommendations on which visualizations may be placed on a designed dashboard. In order to propose such recommendations, threshold values of dataset sizes are used. A dashboard design process, which is considered as the baseline of the proposed dashboard design approach, is outlined. Sample dataset in considered, five data subsets are prepared and recommendations on visualization charts for these datasets, which may be placed on a dashboard, are proposed. Obtained results are discussed, conclusions are made, as well as the further research objectives in this field are formulated.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    In the recent decades, databases have been used in any field of human activity to keep valuable data about ongoing processes. Large amounts of data stored in enterprise databases are useless without having a specialized software tool for data discovery or querying. Most business users that make data-driven decisions usually do not have special training and experience in database querying using special formal languages. Existing solutions are based on ‚Äúquery wizards‚Äù and database query forms that require knowledge of a database schema and inconvenient for users without special training. Proposed approach is based on the content-based filtering of already executed queries by usage frequency and similarity criteria in order to suggest relevant queries that may be re-used. It is a baseline of the interactive adaptive system for data analysis, which design and development is outlined in this study. Software prototype was demonstrated and its usage was discussed. Conclusions were made and future research was formulated.

                </h5>
                <small>
                    Business process management has become the most widely-used and reliable approach to organizational management over the last decades. It is also considered as a part of quality management system in an organization. Business process modeling is the core of business process management, which is used for visualization, analysis, and improvement of organizational activities. Moreover, business process modeling plays an important role in the context of business process management maturity of an overall enterprise. Therefore, this paper is focused on the problem of business process model quality evaluation. Existing approaches based on business process modeling guidelines, measures, and their thresholds are considered. Refined business process modeling rules, measures, quality criteria of numerical and linguistic values, and a method for evaluation of business process model quality are proposed. The corresponding information technology is designed and implemented, and results of its usage are outlined.

                </h5>

                    In the recent decades data has indeed become one of the most valuable assets for government institutions, private businesses, and individual persons. Nowadays almost any software, from social networks and dating mobile applications to large information systems and analytical services for enterprise management, accumulates, stores, and processes data to solve certain problems in their subject areas. Extremely large data volumes are organized in databases that are used as the baseline for almost all of modern software applications. As the most important components of software systems, databases should be carefully designed, since drawbacks at the stage of requirements elicitation may result in exponential growth of defects fixing costs at testing and maintenance phases. Therefore, this study proposes an approach and software tool to database schema generation from textual requirements also known in database design domain as business rules. This may help database designers to rapidly obtain usable database schemas in order to detect and fix defects as early as possible. Moreover, proposed solution may simplify the database design process, since database creation scripts are generated from business rules directly. Thus, instead of coding all the required statements, engineers are only need to check obtained schema and make certain adjustments to data types, unique attributes, or used naming style. This research considers relational model and relational databases, since they are most widely used nowadays. State-of-the-art analysis is made, proposed approach is described in details, software tool with its brief usage examples is described, conclusions are made, and further research directions are formulated.
